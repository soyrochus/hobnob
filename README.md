## Core Intent: Generic Workflow Engine

The code implements a framework that can execute arbitrary multi-step workflows defined in JSON configuration, where:

1. **Declarative Workflow Definition**: Workflows are defined as JSON configurations with steps, prompts, and transitions rather than hardcoded logic
2. **LLM-Powered Step Execution**: Each step uses an LLM to process prompts and return structured JSON responses
3. **Dynamic State Management**: The system maintains and updates state between steps based on LLM outputs
4. **Conditional Flow Control**: Transitions between steps can be conditional based on state values

## Generic Architecture Components

- **`build_graph()`**: Takes any workflow definition and creates an executable LangGraph
- **`render_prompt()`**: Generic prompt templating using state variables
- **`parse_json_from_llm_output()`**: Extracts structured data from LLM responses
- **Conditional routing**: Evaluates transition conditions dynamically

## Current Example: Fibonacci + Limericks

The Fibonacci/limerick flow is just a demonstration - the real value is that you could replace `flow_definition` with any other workflow (e.g., data processing pipelines, decision trees, multi-agent conversations) without changing the core engine.

This looks like a prototype for a more general system (possibly "Hob" based on the project name) that would allow users to define complex LLM-powered workflows declaratively rather than writing custom code for each use case.
